# ReadMe Generator 
ReadMe Generator is an application made with node that makes an easy template where the user can add information to given questions and the application does the rest!

## Installation
Open the file then open the integrated terminal with index.js. In your terminal type "node index" questions will then appear answer the questions and at the end of the program a README.md file is generated for the you. 

### Usage 
Your next project becomes a little easier with an automatic README generator. Just answer the questions and your file is automatically made. ReadMe Generator includes multiple license for use, license badges, license information, also multiple testing utilities!
